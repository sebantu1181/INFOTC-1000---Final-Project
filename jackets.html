        <h3>
            <b><p>They Keep You Warm<p></b> People frequently wear jackets when going outside in the winter.
            Jackets keep us warm due to the material they are made of. Our bodies generate heat, 
            which the material helps to trap and prevent from escaping into the air. This is how we stay warm.</p>

        <h3>
            <p> Add Visual Interest to an Outfit. Do you want to spice up a plain jacket and pair of pants? 
            Adding a great jacket to the ensemble is one way to give it a little more individuality and flair. 
            It doesn't have to be extravagant â€” it's all about expressing yourself and what makes you happy, after all. </p>
