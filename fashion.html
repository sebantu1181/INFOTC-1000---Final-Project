            <p>Wearing certain outfits gives you a sense of confidence and a powerful appearance. 
            You feel that you're on top of the world. This can help you increase your motivation, productivity, and critical thinking. 
            What you wear doesn’t define your value as a human being. But there is an important psychology of clothing that we need to be aware of. 
            It’s important to understand how your clothes impact your thoughts and actions—and how others perceive those thoughts and actions based on what you’re wearing as well.</p>

            <p>According to a pyschologist “When we are confident, we are able to exert influence through our confidence alone.
            When we feel good, we are likely to be perceived as looking good too, as our posture, 
            voice and other nonverbal aspects will be more positive.”</p>
